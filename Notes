Start your React project - npx create-react-app MyLineChart (put this code in the terminal/console). 
Now you will have a folder named MyLineChart and the folder/file arrangement will be somewhat like this 

MyLineChart -
---node_modules
---public
---src
---.gitignore
---package-lock.json
---package.json
---README.md 

Now we will work with the src folder where all the files containing the code for our lineGraph will be saved.
The src folder will look somewaht like this 

src 
---App.css
---App.js
---App.test.js
---index.css
---index.js
---logo.svg
---reportWebVitals.js
---setupTest.js

Here add a new file (inside the src folder) and name it MyLineChar.js, so this will add a new component 

---MyLineChart.js 

in the src folder. 

Now go to your terminal and enter the code below to download MUI X Charts 

npm install @mui/x-charts react@latest react-dom@latest @mui/material@latest @emotion/react@latest @emotion/styled@latest

Check in the package.json file for all these dependencies downloaded properly. 

Now refer to the code I have uploaded. Information about the code will be written in CodeExplanation file.
